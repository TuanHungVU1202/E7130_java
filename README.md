# E7130_java
Assignments for Course E7130 - Aalto university. Mainly working on processing raw data to analyze the performance of network

The course is suppposed to work with Python, but I decided to give Java a try as a practice assignment.
Most things was done with handling the logic and calculation only, and also tried with the JFreeChart lib to plot things.
